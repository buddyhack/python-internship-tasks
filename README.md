# 🐍 Python Internship-Style Tasks

Hi, I'm **KOVVURU VEERA VENKATA SATISH** (`@buddyhack`) and I'm learning Python step-by-step as part of my self-practice and internship-style journey.

This repository contains basic Python tasks I’ve completed while learning from YouTube (especially Jenny Mam ❤️).  
Each file is a small problem I solved to build my logic and skills in Python.

## 📚 Tasks Completed:

- ✅ Task 1: Hobby Greeting

More tasks and mini-projects coming soon 🚀

## ✨ Note:

Some tasks were practiced earlier and are being uploaded now to organize my work.  
All the code is written and understood by me.

This is not a final project — it's my growth journal 👣 in coding.
